            <p> India is home to more wild tigers than any other country—around 70% of the world’s total.
            New tallies from the country’s 2018 tiger survey (called the All India Tiger Estimation) demonstrate a stable or growing population, 
            estimated at 2,967 individuals, bringing hope for the species’ recovery.
            The survey—supported by WWF and conducted by India’s National Tiger Conservation Authority, the Wildlife Institute of India, and state 
            forest departments—is India’s most extensive to date; it covered nearly 150,000 square miles of forested habitats in 20 Indian states. 
            Camera traps deployed at more than 26,000 locations resulted in 76,651 photographs used to identify individual cats.
            These results reflect India’s leadership in tiger conservation. WWF continues to work with governments, local communities, and partners to
             conserve and connect habitats,
             build strong political will and sustained investments, and gain public support for tiger conservation.</p>

            New Delhi: For the second consecutive year, New Delhi has been ranked the world's most polluted capital city, followed by Dhaka (Bangladesh), N'Djamena (Chad), Dushanbe (Tajikistan) and Muscat (Oman). 
            The 2021 World Air Quality Report revealed these facts. The survey of pollution data in 6,475 cities also showed that not a single country managed to meet the World Health Organization's (WHO) air quality standard in 2021, 
            and smog even rebounded in some regions after a Covid-related dip. Only the territories of New Caledonia, US Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico met the updated WHO PM2.5 air quality guidelines.
            Bangladesh topped the list of worlds most polluted countries while Chad came second. India was ranked fifth most polluted country in the world say reports.
            The WHO recommends that average annual readings of small and hazardous airborne particles known as PM2.5 should be no more than 5 micrograms per cubic metre after changing its guidelines last year, 
            saying that even low concentrations caused significant health risks. But only 3.4% of the surveyed cities met the standard in 2021, according to data compiled by IQAir, a Swiss pollution technology company that monitors air quality. 
            As many as 93 cities saw PM2.5 levels at 10 times the recommended level.</p>
